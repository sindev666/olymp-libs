Hi competetive programmers!

By publishing this libraries I hope they will be helpfull & usefull to beginners programmers to understand how many stuff work.
But I hope you will not just copy-paste this code without even looking in it. You cannot win real olympiads, where internet is banned, without ability to write your own variant of this algorithms.

Best wishes and good luck!
Your Mark_Pr.
